# Telco Project
This repo is to provide some insight into the structure of what your first project (and those after) will resemeble. 

## About the Project 

### Project Goals

The project goal is to identify large drivers of churn and come up with a model that acts on those findings so we may take the next steps towards reducing churn.


### Project Description

There are probably many reasons for churn at telco, and some of them may be related to data that we don't have access to. I am conducting this project to dig into what data we do have and uncover some of these factors. If I can find the larger drivers of churn, we can find a path towards reducing that churn as a whole. This would be important towards the growth of the company and possibly even deciding what services and features to roll out at a later time.


### Initial Questions

*Your readme should include initial questions and focus you are going into the analysis with. This is an important part of project planning and gives context to the reader about where you started, what were your initial ideas and thoughts, and did those play out to be true.*

For example: 

What services churn more?

Which contracts churn more?

Is churn related to cost for service?

### Data Dictionary

*Your readme should include a data dictionary, which is important to provide in order to define and disambiguate each of the variables you are analyzing.*

For example: 


| Variable          | Meaning     |
| -----------       | ----------- |
| internet service  |             |
| cost              |             |
| contract length   |             |


### Steps to Reproduce

*Your readme should include useful and adequate instructions for reproducing your analysis and final report.*

For example: 

1. You will need an env.py file that contains the hostname, username and password of the mySQL database that contains the titanic_db.passengers table. Store that env file locally in the repository. 
2. clone my repo (including the acquireTitanic.py and prepare.Titanic.py) (confirm .gitignore is hiding your env.py file)
3. libraries used are pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, stats, numpy, sklearn. 
4. you should be able to run survival_report. 

### The Plan

1.) Hypothesis
2.) Data aquisition
3.) Data cleaning
4.) Exploration
5.) Modeling explored data
6.) Making predictions/drawing conclusions
7.) Making suggestion
